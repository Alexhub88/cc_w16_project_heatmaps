HeatMaps Project

MVP

Create a React based user interface with a Google Maps based API, in order to allow the user to access and control HeatMap layers information from Google Maps.

The heatmap layers should display: temperature, transport, transit, cycling information/routes, earthquake data.

The user interface should allow the user to select the heatmap layer desired and specify sets of lat/long coordinates.

The displays should render maps which display the layer requested at the coordinates specified.

Extensions

Allow the user to specify groups of coordinates and create a suite of displays for the user.

More sophisticated CSS on the displays.

Any further additions you can think of to the user interface or map display suite.
